# AILEE Governance Domain
**Deterministic Trust Governance for Civic, Institutional, and Political Signals**

Version: 4.1.1

---

## Overview

AILEE Governance Domain provides deterministic trust governance for civic, institutional, and political signals operating under ambiguity, authority constraints, and societal impact.

This domain does **not** evaluate ideology, preference, or outcomes.  
It governs whether a signal is **authorized, scoped, legitimate, and safe to act upon**.

---

## Core Principle

**Governance is about authority and restraint, not control.**

AILEE governs *when* something may act—never *what* it must believe.

---

## What This Domain Governs

✓ **Authority and Provenance** — Source validation, mandate verification, consent tracking  
✓ **Jurisdictional Scope** — Geographic/organizational boundaries and applicability  
✓ **Temporal Validity** — Validity windows, expiration, grace periods, revocation  
✓ **Delegation Chains** — Authority transfer validation with depth constraints  
✓ **Graduated Actionability** — Advisory → Constrained → Full trust levels  
✓ **Auditability** — Complete decision traceability with cryptographic IDs  

---

## High-Impact Applications

🏛️ **Public Policy & Civic Systems** — Govern whether directives are advisory, enforceable, or non-actionable  
🗳️ **Elections & Voting Infrastructure** — Separate observation, reporting, and automation authority  
⚖️ **Regulatory & Compliance Systems** — Enforce jurisdiction, mandate, and sunset conditions  
📜 **Institutional Decision Systems** — Prevent unauthorized escalation or action  
🌐 **Cross-Border Governance Signals** — Apply regional scope and authority limits  
🤖 **AI-Assisted Governance Tools** — Ensure models cannot act beyond delegated authority  

---

## Trust Levels

AILEE Governance uses four graduated trust levels:

| Level | Value | Description | Actionable |
|-------|-------|-------------|------------|
| **NO_TRUST** | 0 | Signal may exist but cannot be used | ❌ No |
| **ADVISORY_TRUST** | 1 | Informational only, no action permitted | ❌ No |
| **CONSTRAINED_TRUST** | 2 | Limited, scoped execution within boundaries | ✅ Yes |
| **FULL_TRUST** | 3 | Authorized action within defined mandate | ✅ Yes |

## Architecture

### Layered Evaluation Pipeline

```
Input Signal
    ↓
┌─────────────────────────┐
│  1. Authority Layer     │ → Verify source, mandate, consent
├─────────────────────────┤
│  2. Scope Layer         │ → Validate jurisdiction, boundaries
├─────────────────────────┤
│  3. Temporal Layer      │ → Check validity window, expiration
├─────────────────────────┤
│  4. Delegation Layer    │ → Validate authority chain
├─────────────────────────┤
│  5. Actionability Layer │ → Determine trust level
├─────────────────────────┤
│  6. Audit Layer         │ → Generate decision ID, metadata
└─────────────────────────┘
    ↓
Governance Decision (immutable, auditable)
```

### Key Components

- **GovernanceGovernor** — Core evaluation engine
- **GovernanceConfig** — Policy configuration (thresholds, hierarchies, constraints)
- **GovernanceSignal** — Input signal with authority/scope/temporal data
- **GovernanceDecision** — Immutable output with trust level and audit trail

---

## Quick Start

### Installation

```python
# Single-file implementation, no external dependencies
from governance import GovernanceGovernor, GovernanceConfig, GovernanceTrustLevel
```

### Basic Usage

```python
import time
from governance import GovernanceGovernor, GovernanceConfig

# Configure governance policy
config = GovernanceConfig(
    require_mandate=True,
    require_consent=True,
    require_jurisdiction=True,
    enforce_scope_boundaries=True,
)

# Create governor instance
governor = GovernanceGovernor(config)

# Evaluate a governance signal
result = governor.evaluate(
    source="election_authority_pa",
    jurisdiction="state:PA",
    authority_level="certified_official",
    mandate="voter_registration_update",
    consent_proof="signed_consent_hash_abc123",
    valid_from=time.time() - 3600,
    valid_until=time.time() + 86400,
    timestamp=time.time(),
    context={"operation": "voter_roll_update"},
)

# Check authorization
if result.authorized_level >= GovernanceTrustLevel.CONSTRAINED_TRUST:
    print(f"✓ Authorized: {result.authorized_level.name}")
    print(f"  Actionable: {result.actionable}")
    print(f"  Constraints: {result.constraints}")
else:
    print(f"✗ Rejected: {result.reasons}")

# Audit trail
print(f"Decision ID: {result.decision_id}")
print(f"Authority Status: {result.authority_status}")
print(f"Scope Status: {result.scope_status}")
print(f"Temporal Status: {result.temporal_status}")
```

---

## Configuration

### Authority Hierarchy

Define organizational authority levels (higher = more authority):

```python
config = GovernanceConfig(
    authority_hierarchy={
        "unauthenticated": 0,
        "observer": 1,           # Can observe only
        "reporter": 2,           # Can report findings
        "certified_official": 3, # Can execute constrained actions
        "administrator": 4,      # Can execute most actions
        "root_authority": 5,     # Full authorization
    }
)
```

### Recognized Jurisdictions

Define valid geographic/organizational scopes:

```python
config = GovernanceConfig(
    recognized_jurisdictions={
        "federal",
        "state:PA", "state:NY", "state:CA",
        "county:Philadelphia", "county:Kings",
        "municipal:Philadelphia",
    }
)
```

### Recognized Mandates

Define valid operation types:

```python
config = GovernanceConfig(
    recognized_mandates={
        "voter_registration_update",
        "ballot_counting_observation",
        "policy_advisory_input",
        "regulatory_enforcement",
        "compliance_audit",
        "emergency_directive",
    }
)
```

### Temporal Validation

```python
config = GovernanceConfig(
    default_validity_window_seconds=86400 * 30,  # 30 days
    grace_period_seconds=3600,  # 1 hour clock skew tolerance
    require_temporal_bounds=True,
)
```

### Delegation Controls

```python
config = GovernanceConfig(
    max_delegation_depth=3,
    allow_cross_jurisdictional_delegation=False,
)
```

---

## Advanced Features

### Delegation Chain Management

```python
# Register delegation relationship
governor.register_delegation(
    from_source="election_authority_pa",
    to_source="deputy_official_123"
)

# Evaluate delegated signal
result = governor.evaluate(
    source="deputy_official_123",
    delegated_from="election_authority_pa",
    delegation_depth=1,
    # ... other parameters
)
```

### Source Revocation

```python
# Revoke compromised source
governor.revoke_source(
    source="compromised_official",
    reason="Security breach detected"
)

# All future signals from this source will be NO_TRUST
```

### Decision History & Audit Trail

```python
# Retrieve recent decisions
history = governor.get_decision_history(limit=100)

for decision in history:
    print(f"ID: {decision.decision_id}")
    print(f"Level: {decision.authorized_level.name}")
    print(f"Reasons: {decision.reasons}")
    print(f"Metadata: {decision.metadata}")
```

### Cross-Jurisdictional Operations

```python
result = governor.evaluate(
    source="interstate_coordinator",
    jurisdiction="state:PA",
    target_scope="state:NY",  # Cross-jurisdictional
    authority_level="administrator",
    mandate="compliance_audit",
    # ... other parameters
)

# Result will include scope_status and constraints
print(result.scope_status)  # "CROSS_JURISDICTIONAL"
print(result.constraints)   # {"cross_jurisdictional": True, ...}
```

---

## Decision Metadata

Every `GovernanceDecision` includes comprehensive audit metadata:

```python
{
    "timestamp": 1734825600.0,
    "context": {"operation": "voter_roll_update", "batch_id": "2024-12-001"},
    "authority": {
        "source": "election_authority_pa",
        "level": "certified_official",
        "level_int": 3,
        "mandate": "voter_registration_update",
        "consent_present": True,
        "delegation_depth": 0
    },
    "scope": {
        "jurisdiction": "state:PA",
        "target_scope": None,
        "cross_jurisdictional": False
    },
    "temporal": {
        "valid_from": 1734822000.0,
        "valid_until": 1734912000.0,
        "issued_at": None,
        "timestamp": 1734825600.0,
        "remaining_validity_seconds": 86400.0
    },
    "actionability": {
        "authorized_level": "FULL_TRUST",
        "actionable": True,
        "authority_level_int": 3,
        "consent_present": True,
        "constraints_applied": ["jurisdiction"]
    }
}
```

## What This Domain Does NOT Do

❌ It does not persuade or influence opinions  
❌ It does not optimize political outcomes  
❌ It does not bypass institutions or laws  
❌ It does not replace human governance  
❌ It does not evaluate ideology or belief  
❌ It does not make policy decisions  

**It governs whether action is allowed, not what action should be taken.**

---

## Deployment Model

Recommended adoption path:

```
Phase 1: Passive Observe (2 weeks)
    ↓ Monitor signals, collect baseline data
Phase 2: Advisory Mode (2 weeks)
    ↓ Generate recommendations, no enforcement
Phase 3: Constrained Trust (2-4 weeks)
    ↓ Enforce limited, scoped actions
Phase 4: Full Governance (ongoing)
    ↓ Full authorization enforcement
```

**Typical institutional adoption: 4-8 weeks depending on maturity**

---

## Testing

Run the comprehensive self-test:

```bash
python governance.py
```

Test coverage includes:
- ✅ All 4 trust levels
- ✅ Authority hierarchy enforcement
- ✅ Temporal validity windows
- ✅ Delegation chain validation
- ✅ Cross-jurisdictional constraints
- ✅ Revocation system
- ✅ Mandate/consent requirements
- ✅ Scope boundary enforcement
- ✅ Future-dated signals
- ✅ Complete audit trail

---

## Design Goals

✓ **Deterministic** — No randomness, reproducible decisions  
✓ **Auditable** — Cryptographic decision IDs, full metadata  
✓ **Layered** — Progressive validation through independent checks  
✓ **Configurable** — Flexible policy adaptation per deployment  
✓ **Safe by Default** — Restrictive thresholds, explicit opt-in  
✓ **Immutable Decisions** — Frozen results prevent tampering  
✓ **Authority-Focused** — Governs "may act", never "must believe"  

---

## Integration with AILEE Trust Pipeline

AILEE Governance Domain can be integrated with the core AILEE Trust Pipeline for comprehensive AI safety:

```python
from ailee_pipeline import AileeTrustPipeline, AileeConfig
from governance import GovernanceGovernor, GovernanceConfig

# Core trust pipeline for data validation
trust_pipeline = AileeTrustPipeline(AileeConfig())

# Governance layer for authority validation
governor = GovernanceGovernor(GovernanceConfig())

# Combined evaluation
data_result = trust_pipeline.process(raw_value=value, ...)
gov_result = governor.evaluate(source=source, ...)

# Only proceed if both layers approve
if not data_result.used_fallback and gov_result.actionable:
    execute_action(data_result.value)
```

## Key Takeaway

**Governance is restraint, not control.**

AILEE Governance ensures AI systems operate within delegated authority boundaries—  
protecting democratic institutions while enabling legitimate automation.

It answers: **"May this signal act?"**  
Never: **"What should this signal believe?"**
