Documentation Note (v1.3.0)

Documentation clarification:
Automotive and Power Grid governance domains were conceptually part of the AILEE architecture in v1.3.0 but were not yet accompanied by standalone domain documentation at release time.

Additionally, the Data Center documentation file was relocated to a domain-consistent path (domains/datacenter/) to align with the evolving domain structure.

These were documentation-only oversights. No behavioral, API, or governance logic changes were introduced.
