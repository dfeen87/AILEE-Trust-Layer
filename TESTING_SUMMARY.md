## Real-World Use Cases Validated

### ✅ Multi-Model LLM Ensemble
Combining outputs from GPT-4, Claude, and Llama with confidence tracking
- **Result**: Successfully aggregates with proper weighting

### ✅ Sensor Network with Noise
IoT sensors with occasional bad readings (999.0, -100.0)
- **Result**: Outliers successfully removed, clean data retained

### ✅ Trusted vs. Untrusted Sources
Primary model (95% trust) vs. backup model (5% trust)
- **Result**: Correctly prioritizes trusted source

### ✅ Temporal Consistency
Compare current value against recent historical trend
- **Result**: Rolling window maintains proper history

### ✅ Dynamic API Integration
Fetch peer values from remote API with caching
- **Result**: 10x performance improvement
